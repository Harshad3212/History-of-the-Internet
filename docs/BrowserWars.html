<h4 align="center">Browser Wars</h4>
<hr>
<div class="container">
<p>The internet age began with a vicious power struggle- to decide who would control the future of the emerging internet. Initially the web was used only for a bunch of nerds and people of science and research. The public didn’t know about the internet till the mid 90’s. In 1993, NCSA MOSAIC browser was made by  students from University of Illinois. It was made by Marc Andreesen and his college pals. This browser was free for download, but the only ones who used the internet at that time were scientists. Looking at this browser, Jim Clark (a well known personality in the silicon valley) was interested in founding this.</p>

<p>Clark contacted Andreesen, they both put their thoughts together and wanted to create a browser and make it a business venture. Clark offered a huge sum of money for Andreesen and his college pals, who were still studying. In a few months, NetScape was launched, and Jim Clark was the co-founder. On the 13th of October, 1994, Netscape’s new browser NAVIGATOR entered the market. It was successful, web spread started with this browser.</p>

<p>When the information about the browser was informed to Bill Gates at that time, he wasn’t really interested, and he just ignored it. He wasn’t sure if he should enter this market with a browser. But as soon as Navigator became a hit, Microsoft started getting worried of their position in the computer industry. Initially Microsoft had a meeting with NetScape. Although nobody knows what happened in those meetings, many say that microsoft threatened the company and made them a “deal that they couldn’t refuse”. They offered a sum of 1m$ to have access to their technology. Netscape rejected it. Making deals like this was illegal, and NetScape hired a very famous lawyer from the silicon valley at that time. </p>

<p>Jim Clark wanted Netscape to go public. Initially, their IPO went incredibly well. It exceeded all expectations, and soared through the first day. Clark, who has spent 5m$ has earned around 660m$ at the close of the first day of stocks. In 1993, people didn’t know about the internet and by the end of 1995, the spread of the internet became wide, thanks to this browser.</p>

<p>Marc Andreesen has started disrespecting microsoft. He spoke low of them in public interviews, He disrespected windows developers. Then Microsoft took this up as a challenge. Since, they were a monopoly, they had all the resources, the money, the expertise. Microsoft launched the Internet Explorer for free with their PC’s. By the end of the 90's it was obvious that Microsoft won the Web Wars, by a huge margin. Netscape was later acquired by AOL. Nobody was really disappointed, because they earned a huge amount of money by the time they were taken down.</p>
