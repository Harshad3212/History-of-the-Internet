<p>The invention of the internet happened in a unique way as no one would have imagined.
As the United States was in state of war and information was going to play vital role in it
so the research and development wanted to build communications tools for them in that they found a way using computer networks in which they made a network from computer to computer i.e â€œnetwork of networks".</p>

<p>Though telephone systems were the best way of communication(In the 1960's) as when the phone numbers were called they were dedicated to a transmission line. But when the United States feared the soviet attack they fought they wouldn't be able to communicate through telephone systems once lines were destroyed. Then "Packet Switching" was applied for sending information from one computer network to another. Packet switching was used because data was divided into smaller blocks called packets, so that each packet can travel through different routes and reach its destination. Packets contain
"Header" in which the destination was mentioned as no dedicated path was there.  </p>

<p>Now it was time for an upgrade so they tried time sharing. file sharing through networks. Created a mini copy of the original computer and interconnected the copies. These were later called Interface Message Processor(IMP). Every software and hardware were built for this project as there were no hardware paths for sharing data.Later they were able to send data through it and this is how ARPANet was formed. From this the most used application Email was built. Email was used to send messages from one computer to another in the network.</p>

<p>The Internet was open to all so many academic people were contributing in building or researching and giving feedback upon the Internet. People were coming together so that they could upgrade the Internet to a new level. They were able to find much more things they could do using the internet.</p>

<p>There were also different types of networks built like LAN's, WAN's but everyone had different formats so to keep the networks connected the TCP/IP was introduced. Protocols are a set of rules which networks have to follow so that every network is connected to each other. If networks were different we wouldn't have been
able to share information.</p>

<p>In 9th June 1992 Congress made a decision that the internet was available to the general public to use which helped the internet grow more. As many people used the internet for commercial, business,etc. due to which there was always a competition for better use of the internet.</p>
  <p>Many people were finding it difficult to use or search on the internet so Tim Berners-Lee invented software called the World Wide Web(WWW). WWW used hyperlinks to connect pages. Later user friendly software was introduced for surfing WWW called MOSAIC. MOSAIC had graphical advantage i.e texts, images, videos. After this the web grew significantly.
